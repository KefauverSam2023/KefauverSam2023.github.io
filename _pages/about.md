I am a dedicated and driven environmental advocate with a proven track record of leveraging creative strategies to address complex environmental challenges. With expertise in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a strong commitment to collaborative problem-solving, I am well equipped in my pursuit of excellence, particularly where it involves environmental and social stewardship.

### Skills

Through my academic and professional achievements, I have developed a robust skill set in Geographic Information Systems, with proficiency in ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcMap, and QGIS. Additionally, I have gained experience with various other software tools such as R-Studio, GitHub, Canva, and WordPress.

As an avid and self-motivated learner, I consistently demonstrate a strong work ethic. I am never afraid to ask questions to better understand tasks and responsibilities, and I never shy away from asking for help if I come across an obstacle. I am a team player and enjoy collaborating with others on projects, yet I also thrive when working independently. I always work hard to exceed expectations and submit work well before my deadlines.

### Academic and Work Experience

Through my diverse work experienceâ€“including roles as a GIS Specialist for Baltimore County Government, a Summer Scholars Intern with the Center for Community Engagement, Environmental Justice, and Health (CEEJH), and an Environmental Intern at Carroll County Outdoor School, I have demonstrated exceptional communication skills, leadership abilities, and a commitment to excellence in all tasks.

As an environmental intern in 2018, I developed strong leadership and communication skills by preparing and assisting new volunteer counselors every week. I demonstrated a strong work ethic and commitment to Outdoor School through my consistent preparation of class materials and completion of assigned tasks, as well as my engagement with teachers and camp students to create an engaging and effective learning environment. Through this experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of hands-on, experiential learning.

As a CEEJH Summer Scholars Intern at the University of Maryland, College Park, I gained invaluable experience in the field of environmental justice during the Summer of 2022. In this role, I worked on several projects, including the MD EJScreen tool, the CEEJH Social Media accounts, the Climate Justice Fellows educational modules, and an environmental justice manuscript. Additionally, I helped organize the eighth UMD Environmental Justice Symposium by sending out invitations, assisting with set-up and clean-up processes before and after the event, and helping presenters create an engaging environment throughout the symposium.

My passion for geography and environmental studies is clear through my project portfolio at UMBC. This includes a team consultancy project in partnership with the Environmental Justice Journalism Initiative (EJJI) to create an ArcGIS Story Map on the impact of sea level rise on historically Black communities in Somerset County, Maryland. Working with a team of four accomplished geography students, we demonstrated the significant impacts that sea level rise has on present-day coastal communities and the deep history and culture embedded in these places.

Currently, I serve as a crucial member of the GIS team at Baltimore County Government Office of Information Technology. As a GIS Specialist 1 since November 2023, I have provided cadastral support through meticulous entry of coordinate information and various data, as well as continuous integration of linework updates and new plat records. Through these responsibilities, I play an important role in ensuring that the GIS applications and engineering projects in the county remain current and maintain integrity and functionality. Additionally, I play a pivotal role in supporting county functions by reviewing submittals for new development projects, contributing to efficient turnover with incoming projects. I also serve as a GIS help desk member, actively engaging with other agencies and the public to offer timely assistance and guidance, further reinforcing my commitment to collaborative problem-solving and community engagement.

### Personal Interests

Outside of work and academics, I enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it's walking through parks, hiking in the woods, fishing in a local stream, or simply reading a book while watching the sunset. I have a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature and greatly enjoy spending time exploring and appreciating it in all its forms. This connection to the environment and the outdoors has not only influenced my personal interests and hobbies, but also my academic and professional pursuits.
