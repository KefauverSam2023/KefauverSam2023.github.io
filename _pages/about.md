I am a dedicated and driven individual who is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Geography & Environmental Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, with an expected graduation in May 2023. With a GPA of 3.84.

### Skills

I have excelled academically and have developed a strong skill set in Geographic Information Systems, including proficiency in ArcGIS Pro and QGIS, as well as gaining experience in the use of other software such as R-Studio, GitHub, Canva, and WordPress.

As an avid learner, self-motivated, and responsible person, I consistently demonstrate a strong work ethic. I am never afraid to ask questions to better understand tasks at hand and I never shy away from asking for help if I come across something I lack experience in. I am a team player and enjoy collaborating with others on projects and I also thrive when working independently. I always work hard to exceed expectations and submit work well before my deadlines.

### Academic and Work Experience

Through my work experience in various position, including as a CEEJH Summer Scholars Intern, a Utility Worker at Brightview Senior Living, and an Environmental Intern at Carroll County Outdoor School, I have demonstrated exceptional communication skills, leadership abilities, and a commitment to excellence in all tasks.

As an environmental intern during the Fall and Winter of 2018, I developed strong leadership and communication skills by preparing and assisting new volunteer counselors every week. I demonstrated a strong work ethic and comittement to Outdoor School through my consistent preparation of class materials and completion of assigned tasks, as well as my engagement with teachers and camp students to create a fun and effective learning environment. Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for the importance of hands-on, experiential learning.

During my time at Brightview Senior Living in the Summer and Fall of 2020, I was able to sharpen my teamwork and communication skills while also demonstrating my strong work ethic. As a utility worker, I worked closely with the dining team and community director to ensure that all residents' food and service needs were met. The longer I worked at Brightview, the more I found myself growing into a leadership position in my role, helping train and direct new co-workers and taking on responsibilities beyond what was initially outlined in my position. Through effective communication and collaboration with my team members, we were able to maintain a positive and supportive environment for the residents in the community. 

As a CEEJH Summer Scholars Intern at the University of Maryland, College Park, I gained invaluable experience in the field of environmental justice during the Summer of 2022. In this role, I worked on several projects, including the MD EJScreen tool, the CEEJH Social Media accounts, the Climate Justice Fellows educational modules, and collaborating on an environmental justice manuscript. Additionally, I helped in organizing the 8th UMD Environmental Justice Symposium by sending out invitations, assiting in the set-up and clean-up processes before and after the event, and helping presenters create an engaging environment throughout the symposium.

My passion for geography and environmental studies is clear through projects I have participated in during my time at UMBC. This includes a team consultancy project in partnership with The Environmental Justice Journalism Initiative (EJJI) to create an ArcGIS Story Map on the impact of sea level rise on historically Black communities in Somerset County, Maryland. Working with a team of four other accomplished geography students with diverse skill sets, we demonstrated the vast impacts that sea level rise will have not only on present day coastal communities, but also on the deep history and culture imbeded in these places.

### Personal Interests

Outside of work and academics, I enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it's walking through parks, hiking in the woods, fishing in a local stream, or simply reading a book while watching the sunset. I have a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature and greatly enjoy spending time exploring and appreciating it in all its forms. This connection to the environment and the outdoors has not only influenced my personal interests and hobbies, but also my academic and professional pursuits.
