### Introduction

This project seeks to illustrate the connections between food access and societal demographic factors in Baltimore City, Maryland. Through this study, I have done an analysis of race, median household income, employment, and unemployment in Baltimore City census tracts in order to better understand how these factors affect people's access to different sources of food. Analyzing social factors that play a role in determining food access is important because it helps us understand the correlations between socioeconomic factors such as race and income and how they are related to people's ability to access different types of food. Through these analyses, we are then able to determine who is in most need of improved access to foods and be more vigilant in ensuring that similar populations across the country have access to a variety of foods. This project seeks to expand on work done in other studies, including that of a Gripper et. al. that details how “racial composition, poverty, and food access” are often not independent of one another (Gripper, 2022). My work is also an expansion on studies I have conducted in other classes, including studies of nutritional food access in school throughout the United States.

### Data Methods

The data used in this analysis was aggregated from two sources and then expanded upon through the use of RStudio tools and QGIS. Data surrounding Baltimore City census tracts, which includes population, white population, black population, median household income, employment, and unemployment, was collected using Tidy Census in RStudio. I used the 2021 five year American Community Survey, and set the geometry to be true in order to eventually use the SF tool packages to project the data frame and export the file as a geojson into my data folder. I also cleaned the data in RStudio by removing unnecessary fields given to me by Tidy Census and then setting all null values to be equal to zero. Once these steps were completed, I used the spdep package in RStudio to conduct Morans I tests on all the census field I had collected previously for Baltimore City. Morans I tests is a useful method in determining spacial correlation because the results of the test tells us whether or not “observations are independent of one another” (GISGeography, 2022). Through the Morans I Test, I aimed to determine the randomness of spatial distribution of the different census demographic information, as well as the spatial significance score of said information in order to show how clustering plays an impact in food accessibility. After the RStudio analysis was completed, I began working in QGIS to map the food data and census data I had collected. I collected food data on urban farms, farmers markets, supermarkets, and food stores in Baltimore City from Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future’s ArcGIS data hub. I then used QGIS to first create two web maps, one illustrating healthier food accessibility in terms of access to supermarkets, urban farms, and farmers markets, most of which provide more nutritional, healthier foods (like fruits, vegetables, and fresh foods) in Baltimore alongside all the different census data filters I collected. The other web map illustrated less healthy food accessibility in terms of access to only fast food chains, corner/small grocery stores, and convenience stores, all of which have limited fresh foods and mostly contain pre-packaged and preservative heavy foods (like canned foods, chips, soda, and frozen meals) in Baltimore alongside all the different census data filters I collected. Through these web maps, anyone can click through the different filters to see all of the different fields and understand how food data is correlated to demographic data. I then created three different layouts with multiple maps in each to highlight connections between race, median household income, and access to healthy vs. unhealthy foods.


### Results

The following are links to web maps that I created during my analysis of food access in Baltimore City census tracts. Clicking the links will take you to the two web maps, and all you have to do is check or uncheck the boxes next to different indicators to see them displayed or removed from the maps. The White, Black, Income, Employment, and Unemployment filters all must be turned off and viewed one at a time in order to see the differences between census tracts in terms of each indicator. The most user-friendly way to views these maps would be on desktop or laptop.

The following are the results from the Morans I tests and GIS analyses conducted in RStudio and QGIS:

The most significant findings of the Morans I  tests are that all of the indicators from the census data that I aggregated (White population, Black population, median household income, employed population, and unemployed population) had very small p-values, indicating that the data is spatially clustered together in such a way that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, and they all returned test scores that indicated significant spatial clustering of the indicators in Baltimore City census tracts.

Income, Race, and Supermarkets Mapping<img src='/images/AnalysisofIncomeRaceandSupermarkets.png'>

This set of maps illustrates variations in income between Baltimore City Census tracts as well as population distributions in terms of race across the city. Through these three maps, we see how the distribution of supermarkets throughout Baltimore impacts these three variables, and therefore the populations that live within these tracts. The median household income map, pictured on the left, shows that supermarkets throughout the city are most frequently distributed within high income census tracts, while lower income census tracts have sparsely distributed supermarkets throughout the eastern and western regions of Baltimore. We also see that higher income census tracts are centralized down the middle of the city, with clustering of high income tracts in the inner harbor and in the Northernmost tracts of the city. Looking closer at race, the middle map shows the distribution of white populations in the city, with significant clustering in Northern tracts, extending down the middle of the city into the inner harbor area and Southeastern tracts. Meanwhile, the map on the right shows us significant clustering of Black populations in the Northeastern and Western tracts of the city, which are also tracts with relatively fewer supermarkets compared to the rest of the city. The results of this mapping analysis demonstrates a scarcity of supermarkets in lower income, majority Black census tracts while there is an abundance of supermarkets in higher income, majority White census tracts. These results suggest that access to supermarkets in Baltimore City census tracts is favored toward higher income, White populations in the city while lower income, Black populations are more likely to experience scarce access to supermarkets and the wider variety of food that are offered in these stores.

Income, Food Stores, Fast Food, and Fresh Food Mapping<img src='/images/AnalysisofFoodAccessandMedianHouseholdIncome.png'>

The above maps illustrate variations in income between Baltimore City Census tracts, as well as the distribution of various sources of food, including food stores (like convenience stores and small grocery/corner stores), fast food chains, and fresh food locations (like farmers markets and urban farms) throughout Baltimore. The median household income map base layers show that higher income census tracts are centralized down the middle of the city, with clustering of high income tracts also appearing in the inner harbor region and in the Northernmost tracts of the city. Meanwhile, lower income census tracts are most prominently seen in East, West, and South Baltimore census tracts. The map on the left shows the distribution of food stores in Baltimore, showing a high distribution throughout tracts across the city, with exception of tracts in the North and South. The map in the middle shows similar results for food chains in Baltimore, although there is a lower distribution in the Eastern and Western tracts of the city. The map on the right shows the small distribution of fresh food sources, with urban farms and farmers markets being most prevalent in tracts within the middle of the city. The results from this mapping analysis demonstrates a scarcity of fresh food throughout the majority of city tracts, and especially in terms of farmers markets, which are clustered in higher income tracts. Urban farms are slightly more prevalent in lower income tracts. However, this does not indicate an increased access to healthier, fresher foods, as urban farms “differ from community gardens, as the food is grown for sale, not personal consumption” within the community, presenting a cost barrier in these lower income tracts (Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future, 2022). With this scarcity of fresh food, we see an abundance of food stores and fast food restaurants in low income tracts throughout the city, which offer less nutritious foods that have more preservatives and often are pre-packaged. These results suggest that access to fresh, healthy food in Baltimore City census tracts is favored toward higher income populations in the city while lower income populations are more likely to experience scarce access to fresh foods and wider access to unhealthy, nutritious food sources.

Race and Access to Fresh Food Mapping<img src='/images/AnalysisofFreshFoodAccessbyCensusTractsRacialComposition.png'>

The final set of maps illustrates variations in race between Baltimore City Census tracts, as well as the distribution of fresh food locations, including farmers markets and urban farms throughout Baltimore. The left map shows the distribution of white populations in the city, with significant clustering in Northern tracts, extending down the middle of the city into the inner harbor area and Southeastern tracts. Meanwhile, the map on the right shows us significant clustering of Black populations in the Northeastern and Western tracts of the city. Through both maps, we see smaller distributions of fresh food sources, with urban farms and farmers markets being most prevalent in tracts within the middle of the city. The results of this mapping analysis demonstrates a scarcity of fresh food throughout the majority of city tracts, and especially in terms of farmers markets, which are clustered in majority White tracts, few urban farms and farmers markets in majority Black tracts. These results suggest that access to fresh, healthy food in Baltimore City census tracts is favored toward White populations in the city while Black  populations are more likely to experience scarce access to fresh foods.

### Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that healthy food access in Baltimore City census tracts is strongly dependent upon race and income. The Morans I Tests determined strong spatial clustering of several indicators, including of White and Black populations and median household income. Employment and unemployment were also determined to have some spatial clustering in the city, although correlations between these indicators and food access are not prevalent. These tests also determined that spatial clustering could not have occurred by chance and are therefore not random phenomena. The GIS analysis built upon these findings, suggesting that healthy food access in Baltimore City is dependent upon the racial make-up (specifically between White and Black populations) and median household income of census tracts throughout the city. In lower income and majority Black census tracts, we saw a higher prevalence of unhealthy, pre-packaged food options that can be found in food stores (like convenience stores and small grocery/corner stores) and fast food chains and scare access to fresher, healthy foods that can be found in supermarkets, urban farms, and farmers markets. Meanwhile, higher income and majority White census tracts see greater abundance of fresher, healthier food options. These results indicate a strong correlation between healthy food access and racial and economic indicators, indicating severe inequalities in food and health throughout Baltimore City.
