### Introduction
This webmap was created to show the distribution of Cinemas throughout the state of Maryland. Data was collected using Overpass Turbo, a web application used to analyze data from OpenStreetMap and provide various data outputs. I used ChatGPT to generate queries in order to collect the specific dataset I was looking for. Upon Review of this data, it should be understood that there are many more movie theaters in Maryland than what is shown on my web map. This could be attributed to OpenStreetMap having incomplete data or to the queries being too limited in their parameters.
